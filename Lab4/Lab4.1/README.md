The problem for this part is my chip didn't work at the beginning for some reason. I had my code to work even the TA said it looks fine
but my chip couldn't read any thing. I was borrowed someone else's chip and it works. 
Another difficulty is to set up this icm thing. At first, I didn't know we have to power it up until the professor told me.
