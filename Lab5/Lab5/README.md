The problem I faced was confusing which method we should. On the datasheet, there are two method to use.
One is the HC-SR04 mode and another one is UART.
I tried to use I2C at first but it's working.
Then I tried to use UART which is also not the one we are looking for.

Secondly, my usb port is somehow not working. Everytime I tried to plug in, it will keep reconnect and failed.
At first, I thought it was my esp32c3's problem. This took me a lot of time to fix.
